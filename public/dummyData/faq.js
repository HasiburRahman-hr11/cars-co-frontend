        question:
          "Is It Possible To Drive Another State Registered Car In My City?",
        answer: `<p>Every state has its own rules regarding other state registered cars. Though with the One country one border rule expected around the bend, most states allow various other state registered cars to ply. This resistance to other state cars plying has reduced considerably. Also very soon, a new rule is expected whereby a buyer can just pay a difference in road tax percentage wise and re-register if need. So its advisable to drive an out state registered car with the existing registration and re-register in their own state once this rule comes into effect. Of course, keeping in mind the fact that the easiest and most economical way to drive a car is by retaining the existing registration of the car. It can later be transferred legally in the buyers name in the same state. It is registered by means of a LIC policy and registered rental deed which various RTO agents of the state facilitate in a legal bound framework accepted by the RTO.</p>`,
